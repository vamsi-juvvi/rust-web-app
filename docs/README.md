This is a collection of docs that have two main purposes

 - Document my understanding of Jeremy Chone's code design
 - Document additional refactoring or layering changes on top of it. 

The directorys are prefixed with a number which indicates the chronology of the changes. They are expected to be read in order.

I have provided a [minimal rust setup guide](./README_MinimalRustSetup.md) as well as a [PlantUML & Mermaid guide](./README_PlantUML_Mermaid.md) to facilitate the consumption of the plantuml diagrams I have used.
