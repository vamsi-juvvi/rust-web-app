# Worker Architecture

The standard rust10x web-app is a great starting point for many use-cases. However, when you have a need to go polyglot _(primarily integrating python based workers: Langchain, spacy, plain pytorch etc )_, then you have to figure out how to mix it in with rust based web-server acting as the hub.

While the changes involved here were built incrementally, I am not tracing through the iterative development steps. I am simply summarizing the final changes in a top-down fashion.

At the component level, you are looking at mulitple services that communicate in a hub-spoke model. Client request Ingress is via the hub/gateway and the hub hands off requests to the various workers.

Which architecture you decide on, depends on your priorities. When prototyping, I want velocity and simplicity _(as few services as possible, no more databases than absoluteny necessary)_. This then points me to `Worker` with `JsonRPC` communication.

## Creating a new worker

This gets ahead of the documentation in the rest of the document. However, it also gives you a flavour of how easy it is to use this blueprint variant

```plantuml
@startuml
title Create a new rust worker
:Copy `crates/services/llm-worker` to
 `crates/services/new-worker`
  Replace all `llm-worker` 
  references with `new-worker`;

:Create new entry for 
`crates/services/new-worker` in 
ROOT/Cargo.toml. 
Use `llm-worker` entry 
as example.;

:Add new entry to 
ROOT/.cargo/dev-services.toml 
for `new-worker` and 
decide on a port;

:Update 
`crates/services/new-worker/src/main.rs` 
to reflect the port;

:Write custom RPC calls 
for new-worker;

:Add API calls to 
`web-gateway/examples/quick_dev.rs`
and test your new-worker 
via gateway;
@enduml
```
---

```plantuml
@startuml
title Create a new python worker
:Create the worker wherever;
:Add new entry to 
ROOT/.cargo/dev-services.toml 
for `new-worker` and 
decide on a port;

:Ensure python worker listens on 
**/api/rpc**;

:Ensure your python worker 
is listening on the 
specified port;
@enduml
```


## Worker components

To make just the minimum changes needed and reuse as much of the existing code as possible.

 - extend the rpc URL format of `rpcMethod@http://server/api/rpc` to `rpcMethod@http://gateway/api/rpc/worker`
 - Start simple where worker-name is embedded in the jsonRPC end-point. This is easily extracted from the request without payload (jsonRPC payload i.e.) processing and then dispatched based on an internal worker DNS.
 - reuse `jsonRPC` for the _hub â†’ worker_ communication.

## Single server deployment

![Original Single Server Deployment](../00_base-rust-web-app/img/rustwebapp-deployment.svg)

## Worker deployment

 - Have gateway handle ingress and auth. All API calls go through this.
 - Gateway will demux the incoming RPC request and route it to appop worker. _Worker name is embedded in incoming RPC method_

Since we now want the app to read from another toml file, it was simplest to use it as a config file. The 

# Code changes

There are multiple big changes that need to be performed to enable a worker architecture. Each of them gets its own document. In most cases, there was a lot of incrmental testing _(each worker is a full-blown rust-web-app after all)_.
 
 
  - [Worker service resolution](./Worker_ServiceResolution.md) 
    - Registry information resolving worker names to IPs in development. Production is TBD but likely k8s config.
  - [RPC changes to allow request demuxing](./RPC_RoutingChanges.md) 
    - RPC dispatch code to either dispatch or redirect to a worker based on URL format
    - Limit Cookie auth_token handling to gateway but use a similar middleware in the workers. Gateway to pack the user context into the header for the request to the worker.
  - [LLM Worker using rust-genai](./LLM_Worker.md)
    - expect `Ctx` serialied into a HTTP request header value
    - Replace `ctx_resolver` with a `ctx_leaf_resolver`
    - Use `rust-genai` library
    - create new RPC methods
  - [Request UUID Chain to track request across services](./UUID_RequestCallChain.md) 
    - Generalize the per RPC call UUID into a chain so that a worker can log the source UUID along with it's worker UUID to enable better tracing.
    - worker trace shows things like this: `"rpc_chain":["748eaa50-b8d3-47d6-a4f2-a0b0c8b90850@web-gateway"]` indicating upstream request-uuid and upstream process name.

# Worker deployment In use

After all of these, this function in `quick_dev.rs`

```rust
// -- worker calls via gateway
//
// Note the `"method": "llm-worker/one_shot_msg"` which indicates that
// `"method" : "one_shot_msg"` should be sent to the `llm-worker` worker.
{
    let req_llm_msg = hc.do_post(
        "/api/rpc",
        json!({
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "id": 1,
            "method": "llm-worker/one_shot_msg",
            "params": {
                "data": {
                    "prompt": "why is the sky blue",
                    "mode" : "System"
                }
            }
        }),
    );
    let result = req_llm_msg.await?;
    result.print().await?;
}
```

results in these three traces
